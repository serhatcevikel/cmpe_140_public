 star wars episode iv a new hope from the journal of the whills by george lucas revised fourth draft january 15 1976 lucasfilm ltd a long time ago in a galaxy far far away a vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title war drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity it is a period of civil war rebel spaceships striking from a hidden base have won their first victory against the evil galactic empire during the battle rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the empire's ultimate weapon the death star an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet pursued by the empire's sinister agents princess leia races home aboard her starship custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy the awesome yellow planet of tatooine emerges from a total eclipse her two moons glowing against the darkness a tiny silver spacecraft a rebel blockade runner firing lasers from the back of the ship races through space it is pursed by a giant imperial stardestroyer hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the imperial stardestroyer causing the main solar fin of the rebel craft to disintegrate interior rebel blockade runner main passageway an explosion rocks the ship as two robots artoo detoo r2 d2 and see threepio c 3po struggle to make their way through the shaking bouncing passageway both robots are old and battered artoo is a short claw armed tripod his face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye threepio on the other hand is a tall slender robot of human proportions he has a gleaming bronze like metallic surface of an art deco design another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way threepio did you hear that they have shut down the main reactor we will be destroyed for sure this is madness rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway they aim their weapons toward the door threepio we are doomed the little r2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand threepio there will be no escape for the princess this time artoo continues making beeping sounds tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship threepio what is that exterior spacecraft in space the imperial craft has easily overtaken the rebel blockade runner the smaller rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant imperial starship interior rebel blockade runner the nervous rebel troopers aim their weapons suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke filled corridor in a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire the deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers laserbolts hit several rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke holding shattered arms and faces an explosion hits near the robots threepio i should have known better than to trust the logic of a half sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots exterior tatooine desert wasteland day a death white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon the tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure luke skywalker a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years his shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize winning smile a light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves he is aided by a beatup tread robot with six claw arms the little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions a bright sparkle in the morning sky catches luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt he stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens then dashed toward his dented crudely repaired landspeeder an auto like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic field he motions for the tiny robot to follow him luke hurry up come with me what are you waiting for get in gear the robot scoots around in a tight circle stops short and smoke begins to pour out of every joint luke throws his arms up in disgust exasperated the young farm boy jumps into his landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly interior rebel blockade runner main hallway the awesome seven foot tall dark lord of the sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway this is darth vader right hand of the emperor his face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the imperial stormtroopers everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the rebel troops several of the rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic interior rebel blockade runner a woman's hand puts a card into an opening in artoo's dome artoo makes beeping sounds interior rebel blockade runner threepio stands in a hallway somewhat bewildered artoo is nowhere in sight the pitiful screams of the doomed rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance threepio artoo artoo detoo where are you a familiar clanking sound attacks threepio's attention and he spots little artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke filled alcove a beautiful young girl about sixteen years old stands in front of artoo surreal and out of place dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke she finishes adjusting something on artoo's computer face then watches as the little robot joins his companion threepio at last where have you been stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance threepio they are heading in this direction what are we going to do we will be sent to the spice mine of kessel or smashed into who knows what artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway threepio chases after him threepio wait a minute where are you going artoo responds with electronic beeps interior rebel blockade runner corridor the evil darth vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes he grabs a wounded rebel officer by the neck as an imperial officer rushes up to the dark lord imperial officer the death star plans are not in the main computer vader squeezes the neck of the rebel officer who struggles in vain vader where are those transmissions you intercepted vader lifts the rebel off his feet by his throat vader what have you done with those plans rebel officer we intercepted no transmissions aaah this is a consular ship were on a diplomatic mission vader if this is a consular ship were is the ambassador the rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the dark lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat creating a gruesome snapping and choking until the soldier goes limp vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops vader commander tear this ship apart until you have found those plans and bring me the ambassador i want her alive the stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways interior rebel blockade runner subhallway the lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship she is princess leia organa a member of the alderaan senate the fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder one of the troopers spots her trooper there she is set for stun leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol she starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray the troopers inspect her inert body trooper she will be all right inform lord vader we have a prisoner interior rebel blockade runner subhallway artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod he snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash the stubby astro robot works his way into the cramped four man pod threepio hey you are not permitted in there it is restricted you will be deactivated for sure artoo beeps something to him threepio don't call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease now come out before somebody sees you artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform threepio secret mission what plans what are you talking about i am not getting in there artoo isn't happy with threepio's stubbornness and he beeps and twangs angrily a new explosion this time very close sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway flames lick at threepio and after a flurry of electronic swearing from artoo the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod threepio i am going to regret this interior imperial stardestroyer on the main viewscreen the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken rebel spacecraft chief pilot there goes another one captain hold your fire there are no life forms it must have been short circuited interior lifepod artoo and threepio look out at the receding imperial starship stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy threepio that is funny the damage doesn't look as bad from out here artoo beeps an assuring response threepio are you sure this things safe exterior tatooine anchorhead settlement power station day heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings luke pilots his landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement an old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle shaking her fist at luke as he flies past woman i have told you kids to slow down interior power station day luke bursts into the power station waking the fixer a rugged mechanic and camie a sexy disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap they grumbled as he races through the office yelling wildly fixer did i hear a young noise blast through here camie it was just wormie on another rampage luke bounces into a small room behind the office where deak and windy two tough boys about the same age as luke are playing a computer pool like game with biggs a burly handsome boy a few years older than the rest his flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose fitting tunics of the farm boys a robot repairs some equipment in the background luke shape it up you guys biggs luke's surprise at the appearance of biggs gives way to great joy and emotion they give each other a great bear hug luke i didn't know you were back when did you get in biggs just now i wanted to surprise you hot shot i thought you'd be here certainly didn't expect you to be out working he laughs luke the academy didn't change you much but you are back so soon hey what happened didn't you get your commission biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony biggs of course i got it signed aboard the rand ecliptic last week first mate biggs darklighter at your service he salutes i just came to say good bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons everyone laughs the dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for luke but suddenly he snaps out of it luke i almost forgot there is a battle going on right here in our system come and look deak not again forget it exterior tatooine anchorhead settlement power station day the group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun camie and the fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens luke there they are biggs takes the binoculars from luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye through the binoculars biggs sees two small silver specks biggs that is no battle hot shot they are just sitting there probably a freighter tanker refueling luke but there was a lot of firing earlier camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process luke grabs them luke hey easy with those camie don't worry about it wormie the fixer gives luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation fixer i keep telling you the rebellion is a long way from here i doubt if the empire would even fight to keep this system believe me luke this planet is a big hunk of nothing luke agrees although it is obvious he isn't sure why the group stumbles back into the power station grumbling about luke's ineptitude interior rebel blockade runner hallway princess leia is led down a low ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops they stop in a smoky hallway as darth vader emerges from the shadows the sinister dark lord stares hard at the frail young senator but she doesn't move leia lord vader i should have known only you could be so bold the imperial senate will not sit for this when they hear you have attacked a diplomatic vader don't play games with me your highness you weren't on any mercy mission this time you passed directly through a restricted system several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you leia i don't know what you are talking about i am a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan vader you are a part of the rebel alliance and a traitor take her away leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship an imperial commander turns to vader commander holding her is dangerous if word of this gets out it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate vader i have traced the rebel spies to her now she is my only link to find their secret base commander she will die before she tells you anything vader leave that to me send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed another imperial officer approaches vader and the commander they stop and snap to attention second officer lord vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship and no transmissions were made an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no life forms were aboard vader turns to the commander vader she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod send a detachment down to retrieve them see to it personally commander there will be no one to stop us this time commander yes sir exterior space the imperial stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet tatooine exterior tatooine desert jundland or no man's land where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea the two helpless astro droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland the lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand threepio how did i get into this mess i really don't know how we seem to be made to suffer it is our lot in life artoo answers with beeping sounds threepio i have got to rest before i fall apart my joints are almost frozen artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds threepio what a desolate place this is suddenly artoo whistles makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas threepio stops and yells at him threepio where are you going a stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot threepio well i am not going that way it is much too rocky this way is much easier artoo counters with a long whistle threepio what makes you think there are settlements over there artoo continues to make beeping sounds threepio don't get technical with me artoo continues to make beeping sounds threepio what mission what are you talking about i have had just about enough of you go that way you will be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea threepio and don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it artoo's reply is a rather rude sound he turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas threepio no more adventures i am not going that way artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains exterior tatooine dune sea threepio hot and tired struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes which seem to go on for endless miles he looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas threepio that malfunctioning little twerp this is all his fault he tricked me into going this way but he will do no better in a huff of anger and frustration threepio knocks the sand from his joints his plight seems hopeless when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him threepio wait what is that a transport i am saved the bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport threepio over here help please help exterior tatooine anchorhead settlement power station day luke and biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew fixer and the others can be heard working inside luke very animated so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and came in low on deak's trail i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad uncle owen was pretty upset he grounded me for the rest of the season you should have been there it was fantastic biggs you ought to take it easy luke you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley but those little skyhoppers are dangerous keep it up and one day whammo you are going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall luke look who is talking now that you have been around those giant starships you are beginning to sound like my uncle you have gotten soft in the city biggs i have missed you kid luke well things haven't been the same since you left biggs it is been so quiet biggs looks around then leans close to luke biggs luke i didn't come back just to say good bye i shouldn't tell you this but you are the only one i can trust and if i don't come back i want somebody to know luke's eyes are wide with biggs' seriousness and loyalty luke what are you talking about biggs i made some friends at the academy he whispers when our frigate goes to one of the central systems we are going to jump ship and join the alliance luke amazed and stunned is almost speechless luke join the rebellion are you kidding how biggs quiet down will ya you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater luke i am sorry i am quiet he whispers listen how quiet i am you can barely hear me biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues biggs my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact luke your crazy you could wander around forever trying to find them biggs i know it is a long shot but if i don't find them i will do what i can on my own it is what we always talked about luke i am not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side the side i believe in luke and i am stuck here biggs i thought you were going to the academy next term you will get your chance to get off this rock luke not likely i had to cancel my application there has been a lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left they have even raided the outskirts of anchorhead biggs your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sandpeople with one blaster luke i know but he is got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off he needs me for just one more season i can't leave him now biggs i feel for you luke you are going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important what good is all your uncle's work if it is taken over by the empire you know they are starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the empire luke it couldn't happen here you said it yourself the empire won't bother with this rock biggs things always change luke i wish i was going are you going to be around long biggs no i am leaving in the morning luke then i guess i won't see you biggs maybe someday i will keep a lookout luke well i will be at the academy next season after that who knows i won't be drafted into the imperial starfleet that is for sure take care of yourself you will always be the best friend i have got biggs so long luke biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station exterior tatooine rock canyon sunset the gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes he hears a distant hard metallic sound and stops for a moment convinced he is alone he continues on his way in the distance a pepple tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows a little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path the unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly out of nowhere a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow he manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back his bright computer lights flicker off then on then off again out of the rocks scurry three jawas no taller than artoo they holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot they wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen they hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail exterior tatooine rock canyon sandcrawler sunset the eight jawas carry artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank like vehicle the size of a four story house they weld a small disk on the side of artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine the filthy little jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport interior sandcrawler hold area it is dim inside the hold area of the sandcrawler artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap the narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro robots he lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber interior sandcrawler prison area artoo enters a wide room with a four foot ceiling in the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes some are engaged in electronic conversation while others simply mill about a voice of recognition calls out from the gloom threepio artoo detoo it is you it is you a battered threepio scrambles up to artoo and embraces him exterior tatooine rock canyon sandcrawler sunset the enormous sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge exterior tatooine desert day four imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half buried lifepod that brought artoo and threepio to tatooine a trooper yells to an officer some distance away first trooper someone was in the pod the tracks go off in this direction a second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper second trooper look sir droids exterior tatooine dunes the sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune interior sandcrawler threepio and artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber artoo appears to be shut off threepio wake up wake up suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the sandcrawler stops creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men threepio's fist bangs the head of artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping at the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens filling the chamber with blinding white light a dozen or so jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots threepio we are doomed a jawa starts moving toward them threepio do you think they will melt us down artoo responds making beeping sounds threepio don't shoot don't shoot will this never end exterior tatooine desert lars homestead afternoon the jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives including artoo and threepio in front of the enormous sandcrawler which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house the jawas scurry around fussing over the robots straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow the shrouded little creatures smell horribly attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be out of the shadows of a dingy side building limps owen lars a large burly man in his mid fifties his reddish eyes are sunken in a dust covered face as the farmer carefully inspects each robot he is closely followed by his slump shouldered nephew luke skywalker one of the vile little jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer unintelligible language a voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead luke goes over to the edge and sees his aunt beru standing in the main courtyard beru luke tell owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks bocce luke it looks like we don't have much of a choice but i will remind him luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the jawa leader owen i have no need for a protocol droid threepio quickly sir not in an environment such as this that is why i have also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that owen what i really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators threepio vaporators sir my first job was programming binary load lifter very similar to your vaporators you could say owen do you speak bocce threepio of course i can sir it is like a second language for me i am as fluent in bocce owen all right shut up turning to jawa i will take this one threepio shutting up sir owen luke take these two over to the garage will you i want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner luke but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters owen you can waste time with your friends when your chores are done now come on get to it luke all right come on and the red one come on well come on red let us go as the jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the sandcrawler artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend threepio he is restrained by a slimy jawa who zaps him with a control box owen is negotiating with the head jawa luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro droid's head plate and it sparks wildly luke uncle owen owen yeah luke this r2 unit has a bad motivator look owen to the head jawa hey what are you trying to push on us the jawa goes into a loud spiel meanwhile artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention he lets out with a low whistle threepio taps luke on the shoulder threepio pointing to artoo excuse me sir but that r2 unit is in prime condition a real bargain luke uncle owen owen yeah luke what about that one owen to jawa what about that blue one we will take that one with a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro droid for artoo luke yeah take it away threepio uh i am quite sure you will be very pleased with that one sir he really is in first class condition i have worked with him before here he comes owen pays off the whining jawa as luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry luke okay let us go threepio to artoo now don't you forget this why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity interior lars homestead garage area late afternoon the garage is cluttered and worn but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil near the battered landspeeder little artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face threepio thank the maker this oil bath is going to feel so good i have got such a bad case of dust contamination i can barely move artoo beeps a muffled reply luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two man skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage finally luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench luke it just isn't fair oh biggs is right i am never gonna get out of here threepio is there anything i might do to help luke glances at the battered robot a bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face luke well not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock threepio i don't think so sir i am only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things not on this planet anyways as a matter of fact i am not even sure which planet i am on luke well if there is a bright center to the universe you are on the planet that it is farthest from threepio i see sir luke uh you can call me luke threepio i see sir luke luke laughing just luke threepio and i am see threepio human cyborg relations and this is my counterpart artoo detoo luke hello artoo beeps in response luke unplugs artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body luke you got a lot of carbon scoring here it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action threepio with all we have been through sometimes i am amazed we are in as good condition as we are what with the rebellion and all luke you know of the rebellion against the empire threepio that is how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir luke have you been in many battles threepio several i think actually there is not much to tell i am not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories well not at making them interesting anyways luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from artoo's neck joint he uses a larger pick luke well my little friend you have got something jammed in here real good were you on a cruiser or the fragment breaks loose with a snap sending luke tumbling head over heels he sits up and sees a twelve inch three dimensional hologram of leia organa the rebel senator being projected from the face of little artoo the image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage luke's mouth hangs open in awe leia help me obi wan kenobi you are my only hope luke what is this artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for threepio to translate leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over threepio what is what he asked you a question pointing to leia what is that artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram he looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for threepio to translate leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over leia help me obi wan kenobi you are my only hope help me obi wan kenobi you are my only hope threepio oh he says it is nothing sir merely a malfunction old data pay it no mind luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl luke who is she she is beautiful threepio i am afraid i am not quite sure sir leia help me obi wan kenobi threepio i think she was a passenger on our last voyage a person of some importance sir i believe our captain was attached to luke is there more to this recording luke reaches out for artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle threepio behave yourself artoo you are going to get us in trouble it is all right you can trust him he is our new master artoo whistles and beeps a long message to threepio threepio he says he is the property of obi wan kenobi a resident of these parts and it is a private message for him quite frankly sir i don't know what he is talking about our last master was captain antilles but with what we have been through this little r2 unit has become a bit eccentric luke obi wan kenobi i wonder if he means old ben kenobi threepio i beg your pardon sir but do you know what he is talking about luke well i don't know anyone named obi wan but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea he is kind of a strange old hermit luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments luke i wonder who she is it sounds like she is in trouble i'd better play back the whole thing artoo beeps something to threepio threepio he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system he suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording luke looks longingly at the lovely little princess and hasn't really heard what threepio has been saying luke h'm oh yeah well i guess you are too small to run away on me if i take this off okay luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off artoo's side luke there you go the princess immediately disappears luke well wait a minute where'd she go bring her back play back the entire message artoo beeps an innocent reply as threepio sits up in embarrassment threepio what message the one you are carrying inside your rusty innards a women's voice calls out from another room aunt beru luke luke come to dinner luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot luke all right i will be right there aunt beru threepio i am sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter luke tosses artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room luke well see what you can do with him i will be right back threepio to artoo just you reconsider playing that message for him artoo beeps in response threepio no i don't think he likes you at all artoo beeps threepio no i don't like you either interior lars homestead dining area luke's aunt beru a warm motherly woman fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well used kitchen she puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area luke sits with his uncle owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as aunt beru carries in a bowl of red grain luke you know i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen owen what makes you think that luke well i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him he says he belongs to someone called obi wan kenobi owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name but manages to control himself luke i thought he might have meant old ben do you know what he is talking about well i wonder if he is related to ben owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger owen that old man's just a crazy old wizard tomorrow i want you to take that r2 unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed that will be the end of it it belongs to us now luke but what if this obi wan comes looking for him owen he won't i don't think he exists any more he died about the same time as your father luke he knew my father owen i told you to forget it your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers luke yes sir i think those new droids are going to work out fine in fact i uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season and if these new droids do work out i want to transmit my application to the academy this year owen's face becomes a scowl although he tries to suppress it owen you mean the next semester before harvest luke sure there are more than enough droids owen harvest is when i need you the most only one more season this year we will make enough on the harvest so i will be able to hire some more hands and then you can go to the academy next year luke continues to toy with his food not looking at his uncle owen you must understand i need you here luke luke but it is a whole 'nother year owen look it is only one more season luke pushes his half eaten plate of food aside and stands luke yeah that is what you said last year when biggs and tank left aunt beru where are you going luke it looks like i am going nowhere i have to finish cleaning those droids resigned to his fate luke paddles out of the room owen mechanically finishes his dinner aunt beru owen he can't stay here forever most of his friends have gone it means so much to him owen i will make it up to him next year i promise aunt beru luke's just not a farmer owen he has too much of his father in him owen that is what i am afraid of exterior tatooine lars homestead the giant twin suns of tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range luke stands watching them for a few moments then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead interior lars homestead garage luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight he takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the jawas were carrying he activates the box which creates a low hum and threepio letting out a short yell pops up from behind the skyhopper spaceship luke what are you doing hiding there threepio stumbles forward but artoo is still nowhere in sight threepio it wasn't my fault sir please don't deactivate me i told him not to go but he is faulty malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission luke oh no luke races out of the garage followed by threepio exterior tatooine lars homestead luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro robot threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars threepio that r2 unit has always been a problem these astro droids are getting quite out of hand even i can't understand their logic at times luke how could i be so stupid he is nowhere in sight blast it threepio pardon me sir but couldn't we go after him luke it is too dangerous with all the sandpeople around we will have to wait until morning owen yells up from the homestead plaza owen luke i am shutting the power down for the night luke all right i will be there in a few minutes boy am i gonna get it he takes one final look across the dim horizon luke you know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble threepio oh he excels at that sir interior lars homestead plaza morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard the idyll is broken be the yelling of uncle owen his voice echoing throughout the homestead owen luke luke luke where could he be loafing now interior lars homestead kitchen the interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as aunt beru prepares the morning breakfast owen enters in a huff owen have you seen luke this morning aunt beru he said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early owen uh did he take those two new droids with him aunt beru i think so owen well he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there will be hell to pay exterior tatooine desert wasteland luke's speeder day the rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as threepio pilots the sleek landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland interior/exterior luke's speeder desert wasteland traveling day luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment luke yelling how is that threepio signals that is fine and luke turns back into the wind whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut luke old ben kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but i don't see how that r2 unit could have come this far we must have missed him uncle owen isn't going to take this very well threepio sir would it help if you told him it was my fault luke brightening sure he needs you he'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so threepio deactivate well on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt luke wait there is something dead ahead on the scanner it looks like our droid hit the accelerator exterior tatooine rock mesa dune sea coastline day from high on a rock mesa the tiny landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor suddenly in the foreground two weather beaten sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa one of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired the sandpeople or tusken raiders as they are sometimes called speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument the second tusken raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain exterior tatooine rock mesa canyon the tusken raider approaches two large banthas standing tied to a rock the monstrous bear like creatures are as large as elephants with huge red eyes tremendous looped horns and long furry dinosaur like tails the tusken raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff exterior tatooine rock canyon floor the speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon luke with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder stands before little artoo luke hey whoa just where do you think you are going the little droid whistles a feeble reply as threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway threepio master luke here is your rightful owner we will have no more of this obi wan kenobi jibberish and don't talk to me about your mission either you are fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here luke well come on it is getting late i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up threepio if you don't mind my saying so sir i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you have gotten him back to your workshop luke no he is not going to try anything suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams luke what is wrong with him now threepio oh my sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south luke sandpeople or worst come on let us have a look come on exterior tatooine rock canyon ridge day luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars he spots the two riderless banthas threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer luke there are two banthas down there but i don't see any wait a second they are sandpeople all right i can see one of them now luke watches the distant tusken raider through his electrobinoculars suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view before luke or threepio can react a large gruesome tusken raider looms over them threepio is startled and backs away right off the side if the cliff he can be heard for several moments as he clangs bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain the towering creature brings down his curved double pointed gaderffii the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers but luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle which is smashed to pieces the terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice the sinister raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh exterior tatooine rock canyon floor day artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious sandpeople walk past carrying the inert luke skywalker who is dropped in a heap before the speeder the sandpeople ransack the speeder throwing parts and supplies in all directions suddenly they stop then everything is quiet for a few moments a great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the sandpeople fleeing in terror artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the sandpeople grows even closer until a shabby old desert rat of a man appears and leans over luke his ancient leathery face cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard ben kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy artoo makes a slight sound and ben turns and looks right at him ben hello there come here my little friend don't be afraid artoo waddles over to were luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern ben puts his hand on luke's forehead and he begins to come around ben don't worry he will be all right luke what happened ben rest easy son you have had a busy day you are fortunate you are still in one piece luke ben ben kenobi boy am i glad to see you ben the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly tell me young luke what brings you out this far luke oh this little droid i think he is searching for his former master i have never seen such devotion in a droid before there seems to be no stopping him he claims to be the property of an obi wan kenobi is he a relative of yours do you know who he is talking about ben ponders this for a moment scratching his scruffy beard ben obi wan kenobi obi wan now thats a name i haven't heard in a long time a long time luke i think my uncle knew him he said he was dead ben oh he is not dead not not yet luke you know him ben well of course of course i know him he is me i haven't gone by the name obi wan since oh before you were born luke then the droid does belong to you ben don't seem to remember ever owning a droid very interesting he suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs ben i think we better get indoors the sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers luke sits up and rubs his head artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing luke to remember something he looks around luke threepio exterior tatooine sand pit rock mesa day little artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps luke and ben stand over a very dented and tangled threepio lying half buried in the sand one of his arms has broken off luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on threepio where am i i must have taken a bad step luke can you stand we have got to get out of here before the sandpeople return threepio i don't think i can make it you go on master luke there is no sense in you risking yourself on my account i am done for artoo makes a beeping sound luke no you are not what kind of talk is that luke and ben help the battered robot to his feet little artoo watches from the top of the pit ben glances around suspiciously sensing something he stands up and sniffs the air ben quickly son they are on the move interior kenobi's dwelling the small spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time worn comfort and security luke is in one corner repairing threepio's arm as old ben sits thinking luke no my father didn't fight in the wars he was a navigator on a spice freighter ben that is what your uncle told you he didn't hold with your father's ideals thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved luke you fought in the clone wars ben yes i was once a jedi knight the same as your father luke i wish i'd known him ben he was the best star pilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior i understand you have become quite a good pilot yourself and he was a good friend which reminds me ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around as luke finishes repairing threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on threepio looks at him nervously luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table ben shuffles up and presents luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it ben i have something here for you your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow it he feared you might follow old obi wan on some damned fool idealistic crusade like your father did threepio sir if you will not be needing me i will close down for awhile luke sure go ahead ben hands luke the saber luke what is it ben your fathers lightsaber this is the weapon of a jedi knight not as clumsy or as random as a blaster luke pushes a button on the handle a long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there the light plays across the ceiling ben an elegant weapon for a more civilized time for over a thousand generations the jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old republic before the dark times before the empire luke hasn't really been listening luke how did my father die ben a young jedi named darth vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knights he betrayed and murdered your father now the jedi are all but extinct vader was seduced by the dark side of the force luke the force ben well the force is what gives a jedi his power it is an energy field created by all living things it surrounds us and penetrates us it binds the galaxy together artoo makes beeping sounds ben now let us see if we can't figure out what you are my little friend and where you come from luke i saw part of the message he was luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young rebel princess is projected from artoo's face ben i seem to have found it luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes leia general kenobi years ago you served my father in the clone wars now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire i regret that i am unable to present my father's request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and i am afraid my mission to bring you to alderaan has failed i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r2 unit my father will know how to retrieve it you must see this droid safely delivered to him on alderaan this is our most desperate hour help me obi wan kenobi you are my only hope there is a little static and the transmission is cut short old ben leans back and scratches his head he silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe luke has stars in his eyes ben you must learn the ways of the force if you are to come with me to alderaan luke laughing alderaan i am not going to alderaan i have got to go home it is late i am in for it as it is ben i need your help luke she needs your help i am getting too old for this sort of thing luke i can't get involved i have got work to do it is not that i like the empire i hate it but there is nothing i can do about it right now it is such a long way from here ben that is your uncle talking luke sighing oh god my uncle how am i ever going to explain this ben learn about the force luke luke look i can take you as far as anchorhead you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever you are going ben you must do what you feel is right of course exterior space an imperial stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet like battle station the death star interior death star conference room eight imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room commander tagge a young slimy looking general is speaking tagge until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable the rebel alliance is too well equipped they are more dangerous than you realize the bitter admiral motti twists nervously in his chair motti dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station tagge the rebellion will continue to gain a support in the imperial senate as long as suddenly all heads turn as commander tagge's speech is cut short and the grand moff tarkin governor of the imperial outland regions enters he is followed by his powerful ally the sith lord darth vader all of the generals stand and bow before the thin evil looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table the dark lord stands behind him tarkin the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us i have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away tagge that is impossible how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy tarkin the regional governors now have direct control over territories fear will keep the local systems in line fear of this battle station tagge and what of the rebellion if the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it vader the plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands motti any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data they have obtained this station is now the ultimate power in the universe i suggest we use it vader don't be too proud of this technological terror you have constructed the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force motti don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways lord vader your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebel's hidden fort suddenly motti chokes and starts to turn blue under vader's spell vader i find your lack of faith disturbing tarkin enough of this vader release him vader as you wish tarkin this bickering is pointless lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke exterior tatooine wasteland the speeder stops before what remains of the huge jawas sandcrawler luke and ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies luke it looks like sandpeople did this all right look here are gaffi sticks bantha tracks it is just i never heard of them hitting anything this big before ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks ben they didn't but we are meant to think they did these tracks are side by side sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers luke these are the same jawas that sold us artoo and threepio ben and these blast points too accurate for sandpeople only imperial stormtroopers are so precise luke why would imperial troops want to slaughter jawas luke looks back at the speeder where artoo and threepio are inspecting the dead jawas and put two and two together luke if they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to and that would lead them home luke reaches a sudden horrible realization then races for the speeder and jumps it ben wait luke it is too dangerous luke races off leaving ben and the two robots alone with the burning sandcrawler exterior tatooine wasteland luke races across the wasteland in his battered landspeeder exterior tatooine lars homestead the speeder roars up to the burning homestead luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place luke uncle owen aunt beru uncle owen luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains he is stunned and cannot speak hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him exterior space imperial tie fighter races toward the death star interior death star detention corridor two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several imperial guards to enter princess leia's face is filled with defiance which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters followed by darth vader vader and now your highness we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base the torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches princess leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle the door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful the muffled screams of the rebel princess are barely heard exterior tatooine wasteland there is a large bonfire of jawa bodies blazing in front of the sandcrawler as ben and the robots finish burning the dead luke drives up in the speeder and ben walks over to him ben there is nothing you could have done luke had you been there you'd have been killed too and the droids would be in the hands of the empire luke i want to come with you to alderaan there is nothing here for me now i want to learn the ways of the force and become a jedi like my father exterior tatooine wasteland the landspeeder with luke artoo threepio and ben in it zooms across the desert the speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at mos eisley it is a haphazard array of low grey concrete structures and semi domes a harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where ben is standing ben mos eisley spaceport you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy we must be cautious ben looks over at luke who gives the old jedi a determined smile exterior tatooine mos eisley street the speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots a trooper questions luke trooper how long have you had these droids luke about three or four seasons ben they are for sale if you want them trooper let me see your identification luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his id while ben speaks to the trooper in a very controlled voice ben you don't need to see his identification trooper we don't need to see his identification ben these are not the droids your looking for trooper these are not the droids we are looking for ben he can go about his business trooper you can go about your business ben to luke move along trooper move along move along exterior tatooine mos eisley street the speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport various strange forms of transport including several unusual beasts of burden are parked outside the bar a jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder threepio i can't abide these jawas disgusting creatures as luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the jawa away luke go on go on i can't understand how we got by those troopers i thought we were dead ben the force can have a strong influence on the weak minded you will find it a powerful ally luke do you really think we are going to find a pilot here that will take us to alderaan ben well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here only watch your step this place can be a little rough luke i am ready for anything threepio come along artoo interior tatooine mos eisley cantina the young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow ben kenobi into the smoke filled cantina the murky moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar at first the sight is horrifying one eyed thousand eyed slimy furry scaly tentacled and clawed creatures huddle over drinks ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum a huge rough looking bartender stops luke and the robots bartender we don't serve their kind here luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift luke what bartender your droids they will have to wait outside we don't want them here luke looks at old ben who is busy talking to one of the galactic pirates he notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare luke pats threepio on the shoulder luke listen why don't you wait out by the speeder we don't want any trouble threepio i heartily agree with you sir threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks ben is standing next to chewbacca an eight foot tall savage looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon like fangs his large blue eyes dominate a fur covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance over his matted furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers and little else he is a two hundred year old wookiee and a sight to behold ben speaks to the wookiee pointing to luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between ben and the giant wookiee luke is terrified but tries not to show it he quietly sips his drink looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever a large multiple eyed creature gives luke a rough shove creature negola dewaghi wooldugger the hideous freak is obviously drunk luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink a short grubby human and an even smaller rodent like beast join the belligerent monstrosity human he doesn't like you luke i am sorry human i don't like you either the big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous young adventurer human continued don't insult us you just watch yourself we are wanted men i have the death sentence in twelve systems luke i will be careful than human you will be dead the rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy his three adversaries ready their weapons old ben moves in behind luke ben this little one isn't worth the effort come let me buy you something a powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would be jedi sailing across the room crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul looking liquid with a blood curdling shriek the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old ben the bartender panics bartender no blasters no blaster with astounding agility old ben's laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor the rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple eyed creature lies doubled cut from chin to groin ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt luke shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities attempts to stand the entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds the cantina goes back to normal although ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar luke rubbing his bruised head approaches the old man with new awe ben points the the wookiee ben this is chewbacca he is first mate on a ship that might suit our needs exterior tatooine mos eisley street threepio paces in front of the cantina as artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro droid a creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street threepio i don't like the look of this interior tatooine mos eisley cantina strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd looking instruments as luke still giddy downs a fresh drink and follows ben and chewbacca to a booth where han solo is sitting han is a tough roguish starpilot about thirty years old a mercenary on a starship he is simple sentimental and cocksure han han solo i am captain of the millennium falcon chewie here tells me you are looking for passage to the alderaan system ben yes indeed if it is a fast ship han fast ship you have never heard of the millennium falcon ben should i have han it is the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs ben reacts to solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation han continued i have outrun imperial starships not the local bulk cruisers mind you i am talking about the big corellian ships now she is fast enough for you old man what is the cargo ben only passengers myself the boy two droids and no questions asked han what is it some kind of local trouble ben let us just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements han well that is the trick isn't it and it is going to cost you something extra ten thousand in advance luke ten thousand we could almost buy our own ship for that han but who is going to fly it kid you luke you bet i could i am not such a bad pilot myself we don't have to sit here and listen ben we haven't that much with us but we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach alderaan han seventeen huh han ponders this for a few moments han okay you guys got yourself a ship we will leave as soon as you are ready docking bay ninety four ben ninety four han looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork ben and luke turn around to see four imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions the bartender points to the booth trooper all right we will check it out the stormtroopers look over at the booth but luke and ben are gone the bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement han seventeen thousand those guys must really be desperate this could really save my neck get back to the ship and get her ready exterior tatooine mos eisley street

boss tell jabba that i have got his money han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him greedo it is too late you should have paid him when you had the chance jabba's put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you i am lucky i found you first han yeah but this time i got the money greedo if you give it to me i might forget i found you han i don't have it with me tell jabba greedo jabba's through with you he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser han even i get boarded sometimes do you think i had a choice han solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table greedo you can tell that to jabba he may only take your ship han over my dead body greedo that is the idea i have been looking forward to killing you for a long time han yes i will bet you have suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the

millennium falcon cockpit the ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window han here's where the fun begins ben how long before you can make the jump to light speed han it will take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi computer the ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it luke are you kidding at the rate they are gaining han traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops boy without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick wouldn't it the ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash luke what is that flashing han we are losing our deflector shield go strap yourself in i am going to make the jump to light speed the galaxy brightens and they move faster almost as if crashing a barrier stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace exterior space the millennium falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second exterior death star alderaan looms behind the death star battlestation interior death star control room admiral motti enters the quiet control room and bows before governor tarkin who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet motti we have entered the alderaan system vader and two stormtroopers enter with princess leia her hands are bound leia governor tarkin i should have expected to find you holding vader's leash i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board tarkin charming to the last you don't know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life leia i surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself tarkin princess leia before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational no star system will dare oppose the emperor now leia the more you tighten your grip tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers tarkin not after we demonstrate the power of this station in a way you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base i have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of alderaan leia no alderaan is peaceful we have no weapons you can't possibly tarkin you would prefer another target a military target then name the system tarkin waves menacingly toward leia tarkin i grow tired of asking this so it will be the last time where is the rebel base leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to alderaan leia softly dantooine leia lowers her head leia they are on dantooine tarkin there you see lord vader she can be reasonable addressing motti continue with the operation you may fire when ready leia what tarkin you are far too trusting dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration but don't worry we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough leia no interior death star blast chamber vader commence primary ignition a button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights a hooded imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever another lever is pulled vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up a huge beam of light emanates from within a cone shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward alderaan the small green planet of alderaan is blown into space dust interior millennium falcon central hold area ben watches luke practice the lightsaber with a small seeker robot ben suddenly turns away and sits down he falters seems almost faint luke are you all right what is wrong ben i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happened ben rubs his forehead he seems to drift into a trance then he fixes his gaze on luke ben you'd better get on with your exercises han solo enters the room han well you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs i told you i'd outrun 'em luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber han don't everyone thank me at once threepio watches chewbacca and artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three dimensional holographic figures move along a chess type board han anyway we should be at alderaan about oh two hundred hours chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur covered arms over his head threepio now be careful artoo artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square a sudden frown crosses chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge wookiee threepio he made a fair move screaming about it won't help you han interrupting let him have it it is not wise to upset a wookiee threepio but sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid han that is 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose wookiees are known to do that threepio i see your point sir i suggest a new strategy artoo let the wookiee win luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place a humming lightsaber is held high over his head ben watches him from the corner studying his movements han watches with a bit of smugness ben remember a jedi can feel the force flowing through him luke you mean it controls your actions ben partially but it also obeys your commands suspended at eye level about ten feet in front of luke a seeker a chrome baseball like robot covered with antennae hovers slowly in a wide arc the ball floats to one side of the youth then the other suddenly it makes a lightning swift lunge and stops within a few feet of luke's face luke doesn't move and the ball backs off it slowly moves behind the boy then makes another quick lunge this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks it hits luke in the leg causing him to tumble over han lets loose with a burst of laughter han hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid luke you don't believe in the force do you han kid i have flown from one side of this galaxy to the other i have seen a lot of strange stuff but i have never seen anything to make me believe there is one all powerful force controlling everything there is no mystical energy field that controls my destiny ben smiles quietly han it is all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense ben i suggest you try it again luke ben places a large helmet on luke's head which covers his eyes ben this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct luke laughing with the blast shield down i can't even see how am i supposed to fight ben your eyes can deceive you don't trust them han skeptically shakes his head as ben throws the seeker into the air the ball shoots straight up in the air then drops like a rock luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker which fires off a laserbolt which hits luke square on the seat of the pants he lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker ben stretch out with your feelings luke stands in one place seemingly frozen the seeker makes a dive at luke and incredibly he managed to deflect the bolt the ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position ben you see you can do it han i call it luck ben in my experience there is no such thing as luck han look going good against remotes is one thing going good against the living that is something else solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel han looks like we are coming up on alderaan han and chewbacca head back to the cockpit luke you know i did feel something i could almost see the remote ben that is good you have taken your first step into a larger world interior death star conference room imperial officer cass stands before governor tarkin and the evil dark lord darth vader tarkin yes officer cass our scout ships have reached dantooine they found the remains of a rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time they are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems tarkin she lied she lied to us vader i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion tarkin terminate her immediately exterior hyperspace the pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship interior millennium falcon cockpit han stand by chewie here we go cut in the sublight engines han pulls back on a control lever outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past seem to decrease in speed then stop suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about asteroids begin to race toward them battering the sides of the ship han what the aw we have come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower some kind of asteroid collision it is not on any of the charts the wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit luke what is going on han our position is correct except no alderaan luke what do you mean where is it han thats what i am trying to tell you kid it ain't there it is been totally blown away luke what how ben moves into the cockpit behind luke as the ship begins to settle down ben destroyed by the empire han the entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet it'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than i have a signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming han there is another ship coming in luke maybe they know what happened ben it is an imperial fighter chewbacca barks his concern a huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window shaking the ship violently a tiny finned imperial tie fighter races past the cockpit window luke it followed us ben no it is a short range fighter han there aren't any bases around here where did it come from exterior space the fighter races past the corellian pirateship interior millennium falcon cockpit luke it sure is leaving in a big hurry if they identify us we are in big trouble han not if i can help it chewie jam it is transmissions ben it'd be as well to let it go it is too far out of range han not for long exterior space the pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the imperial tie fighter interior millennium falcon cockpit the tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter in the distance one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the tie ship is heading for it ben stands behind chewbacca ben a fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own luke it must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something han well he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us exterior space the tie fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head interior millennium falcon cockpit the distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet luke look at him he is headed for that small moon han i think i can get him before he gets there he is almost in range the small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station ben that is no moon it is a space station han it is too big to be a space station luke i have a very bad feeling about this han yeah i think your right full reverse chewie lock in the auxiliary power the pirateship shudders and the tie fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station luke why are we still moving towards it han we are caught in a tractor beam it is pulling us in luke but there is gotta be something you can do han there is nothin' i can do about it kid i am in full power i am going to have to shut down but they are not going to get me without a fight ben kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder ben you can't win but there are alternatives to fighting interior millennium falcon death star as the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged exterior death star huge port doors the helpless millennium falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons voice over death star intercom clear bay twenty three seven we are opening the magnetic field interior death star docking bay 2037 the pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the death star coming to rest in a huge hangar thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area officer to you stations officer to another officer come with me interior death star hallway stormtroopers run to their posts interior death star hangar 2037 a line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire officer close all outboard shields close all outboard shields interior death star conference room tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz tarkin yes voice over intercom we have captured a freighter entering the remains of the alderaan system it is markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of mos eisley vader they must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess she may yet be of some use to us interior death star docking bay 2037 vader and a commander approach the troops as an officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft voice over intercom unlock one five seven and nine release charges officer to vader there is no one on board sir according to the log the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff it must be a decoy sir several of the escape pods have been jettisoned vader did you find any droids officer no sir if there were any on board they must also have jettisoned vader send a scanning crew on board i want every part of this ship checked officer yes sir vader i sense something a presence i haven't felt since vader turns quickly and exits the hangar officer get me a scanning crew in here on the double i want every part of this ship checked interior millennium falcon hallway a trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit in a few moments all is quiet the muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing han solo and luke ben kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker luke boy it is lucky you had these compartments han i use them for smuggling i never thought i'd be smuggling myself in them this is ridiculous even if i could take off i'd never get past the tractor beam ben leave that to me han damn fool i knew that you were going to say that ben who is the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him han shakes his head muttering to himself chewbacca agrees interior death star main forward bay the crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp trooper the ship's all yours if the scanners pick up anything report it immediately all right let us go the crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below han's voice hey down there could you give us a hand with this the stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard interior death star forward bay command office in a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship a gantry officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing he speaks into the comlink gantry officer tx four one two why aren't you at your post tx four one two do you copy a stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working the gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door giving his aide an annoyed look gantry officer take over we have got a bad transmitter i will see what i can do as the officer approaches the door it slides open revealing the towering chewbacca the gantry officer in a momentary state of shock stumbles backward with a bone chilling howl the giant wookiee flattens the officer with one blow the aide immediately reaches for his pistol but is blasted by han dressed as an imperial stormtrooper ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by luke also dressed as a stormtrooper luke quickly removes his helmet luke you know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight it is a wonder the whole station doesn't know we are here han bring them on i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around threepio we found the computer outlet sir ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor he begins to inspect it carefully threepio and artoo look over the control panel artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly ben plug in he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast imperial brain network comes to life feeding information to the little robot after a few moments he beeps something threepio he says he is found the main computer to power the tractor beam that is holding the ship here he will try to make the precise location appear on the monitor the computer monitor flashes readouts threepio the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave ben studies the data on the monitor readout ben i don't think you boys can help i must go alone han whatever you say i have done more that i bargained for on this trip already luke i want to go with you ben be patient luke stay and watch over the droids luke but he can ben they must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as alderaan your destiny lies along a different path than mine the force will be with you always ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office then disappears down a long grey hallway chewbacca barks a comment and han shakes his head in agreement han boy you said it chewie han looks at luke han where did you dig up that old fossil luke ben is a great man han yeah great at getting us into trouble luke i didn't hear you give any ideas han well anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up luke who do you think suddenly artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak luke goes over to him luke what is it threepio i am afraid i am not quite sure sir he says i found her and keeps repeating she is here luke well who who has he found artoo whistles a frantic reply threepio princess leia luke the princess she is here han princess what is going on threepio level five detention block a a twenty three i am afraid she is scheduled to be terminated luke oh no we have got to do something han what are you talking about luke the droid belongs to her she is the one in the message we have got to help her han now look don't get any funny ideas the old man wants us to wait right here luke but he didn't know she was here look will you just find a way back into the detention block han i am not going anywhere luke they are going to execute her look a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured now all you want to do is stay han marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind luke but they are going to kill her han better her than me luke she is rich chewbacca growls han rich luke yes rich powerful listen if you were to rescue her the reward would be han what luke well more wealth that you can imagine han i don't know i can imagine quite a bit luke you will get it han i better luke you will han all right kid but you'd better be right about this han looks at chewie who grunts a short grunt luke all right han what is your plan luke uh threepio hand me those binders there will you luke moves toward chewbacca with electronic cuffs luke okay now i am going to put these on you chewie lets out a hideous growl luke okay han you put these on luke sheepishly hands the binders to han han don't worry chewie i think i know what he has in mind the wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as han binds him with the electronic cuffs threepio master luke sir pardon me for asking but ah what should artoo and i do if we are discovered here luke lock the door han and hope they don't have blasters threepio that isn't very reassuring luke and han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant imperial death star interior death star detention area elevator tube han and luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive troops bureaucrats and robots bustle about ignoring the trio completely only a few give the giant wookiee a curious glance finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters luke i can't see a thing in this helmet a bureaucrat races to get aboard also but is signaled away by han the door to the pod like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube interior death star main hallway several imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway they pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to threepio but with an insect face at the far end of the hallway a passing flash of ben kenobi appears then disappears down a small hallway his appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion no one in the hallway seems to notice him interior death star interior elevator detention security area luke and han step forward to exit the elevator but the door slides open behind them the giant wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station guards and laser gates are everywhere han whispers to luke under his breath han this is not going to work luke why didn't you say so before han i did say so before interior detention area elevator doors open a tall grim looking officer approaches the trio officer where are you taking this thing chewie growls a bit at the remark but han nudges him to shut up luke prisoner transfer from block one one three eight officer i wasn't notified i will have to clear it the officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information there are only three other troopers in the area luke and han survey the situation checking all of the alarms laser gates and camera eyes han unfastens one of chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to luke suddenly chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear piercing howls he grabs han's laser rifle han look out he is loose luke he is going to pull us all apart han go get him the startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded luke and han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying wookiee their barrage of laserfire misses chewbacca but hits the camera eyes laser gate controls and the imperial guards the officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system han rushes to the comlink system which is screeching questions about what is going on he quickly checks the computer readout han we have got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in here it is cell twenty one eight seven you go get her i will hold them here luke races down one of the cell corridors han speaks into the buzzing comlink han sounding official everything is under control situation normal intercom voice what happened han getting nervous uh had a slight weapons malfunction but uh everything's perfectly all right now we are fine we are all fine here now thank you how are you intercom voice we are sending a squad up han uh uh negative we had a reactor leak here now give us a few minutes to lock it down large leak very dangerous intercom voice who is this what is your operating number han blasts the comlink and it explodes han boring conversation anyway yelling down the hall luke we are going to have company interior death star cell row luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol when the smoke clears luke sees the dazzling young princess senator she had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open leia finally aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper luke takes off his helmet coming out of it luke what oh the uniform i am luke skywalker i am here to rescue you leia you are who luke i am here to rescue you i have got your r2 unit i am here with ben kenobi leia ben kenobi is here where is he luke come on interior death star conference room darth vader paces the room as governor tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table vader he is here tarkin obi wan kenobi what makes you think so vader a tremor in the force the last time i felt it was in the presence of my old master tarkin surely he must be dead by now vader don't underestimate the power of the force tarkin the jedi are extinct their fire has gone out of the universe you my friend are all that is left of their religion there is a quiet buzz on the comlink tarkin yes intercom voice governor tarkin we have an emergency alert in detention block a a twenty three tarkin the princess put all sections on alert vader obi wan is here the force is with him tarkin if you are right he must not be allowed to escape vader escape is not his plan i must face him alone interior death star detention area hallway an ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door han chewie chewbacca responds with a growling noise han get behind me get behind me a series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several imperial troops begin to emerge han and chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame they turn and run down the cell hallway meeting up with luke and leia rushing toward them han can't get out that way leia looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route han sarcastically maybe you'd like it back in your cell your highness luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor luke see threepio see threepio threepio over comlink yes sir luke we have been cut off are there any other ways out of the cell bay what was that i didn't copy interior death star main bay gantry control tower threepio paces the control center as little artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter threepio i said all systems have been alerted to your presence sir the main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted someone begins banging on the door trooper voice open up in there threepio oh no interior death star detention corridor luke and leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops han and chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway the laserfire is very intense and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor luke there isn't any other way out han i can't hold them off forever now what leia this is some rescue when you came in here didn't you have a plan for getting out han pointing to luke he is the brains sweetheart luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders luke well i didn't the princess grabs luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to han almost frying him han what the hell are you doing leia somebody has to save our skins into the garbage chute wise guy she jumps through the narrow opening as han and chewbacca look on in amazement chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something han get in there you big furry oaf i don't care what you smell get in there and don't worry about it han gives him a kick and the wookiee disappears into the tiny opening luke and han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening han wonderful girl either i am going to kill her or i am beginning to like her get in there luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover then slides into the chute himself and is gone interior death star garbage room han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit he finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open it won't budge han sarcastically oh the garbage chute was a really wonderful idea what an incredible smell you have discovered let us get out of here get away from there luke no wait han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch the laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face luke will you forget it i already tried it it is magnetically sealed leia put that thing away you are going to get us all killed han absolutely your worship look i had everything under control until you led us down here you know it is not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us leia it could be worst a loud horrible inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away han and luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn the wookiee is cowering near one of the walls han it is worst luke there is something alive in here han that is your imagination luke something just moves past my leg look did you see that han what luke help suddenly luke is yanked under the garbage han luke luke luke solo tries to get to luke luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs a membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat leia luke leia extends a long pipe toward him leia luke luke grab a hold of this luke blast it will you my gun's jammed han where luke anywhere oh solo fires his gun downward luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle han luke luke suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches then everything is deathly quiet han and leia give each other a worried look as chewbacca howls in the corner with a rush of bubbles and muck luke suddenly bobs to the surface leia grab him luke seems to be released by the thing leia what happened luke i don't know it just let go of me and disappeared han i have got a very bad feeling about this before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the rebels luke the walls are moving leia don't just stand there try to brace it with something they place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on the situation doesn't look too good luke wait a minute luke pulls out his comlink luke threepio come in threepio threepio where could he be interior death star main gantry command office a soft buzzer and the muted voice of luke calling out for see threepio can be heard on threepio's hand comlink which is sitting on the deserted computer console artoo and threepio are nowhere in sight suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber first trooper take over pointing to the dead officer see to him look there a trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open see threepio and artoo detoo are inside artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office threepio they are madmen they are heading for the prison level if you hurry you might catch them first officer to his troops follow me you stand guard the troops hustle off down the hallway leaving a guard to watch over the command office threepio to artoo come on the guard aims a blaster at them threepio oh all this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here if you don't mind i'd like to take him down to maintenance trooper all right the guard nods and threepio with little artoo in tow hurries out the door interior death star garbage room as the walls rumble closed the room gets smaller and smaller chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws han is leaning back against the other wall garbage is snapping and popping luke is trying to reach threepio luke threepio come in threepio threepio han and leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole leia begins to sink into the trash han get to the top leia i can't luke where could he be threepio threepio will you come in interior death star main forward bay service panel threepio they aren't here something must have happened to them see if they have been captured little artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot threepio hurry interior death star garbage room the walls are only feet apart leia and han are braced against the walls the princess is frightened they look at each other leia reaches out and takes han's hand and she holds it tightly she is terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body han one thing's for sure we are all going to be a lot thinner to leia get on top of it leia i am trying interior death star main forward bay service panel threepio to artoo thank goodness they haven't found them where could they be artoo frantically beeps something to see threepio threepio use the comlink oh my i forgot i turned it off interior death star garbage room meanwhile luke is lying on his side trying to keep his head above the rising ooze luke's comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt interior death star main forward bay service panel muffled sounds of luke's voice over the comlink can be heard but not distinctly threepio are you there sir interior death star garbage room luke threepio interior death star main forward bay service panel threepio we have had some problems luke over comlink will you shut up and listen to me shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level will you do you copy interior death star garbage room luke shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level interior death star main forward bay service panel luke over comlink shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level threepio to artoo no shut them all down hurry threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from luke's comlink threepio listen to them they are dying artoo curse my metal body i wasn't fast enough it is all my fault my poor master luke over comlink threepio we are all right interior death star garbage room the screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief the walls have stopped moving han chewie and leia embrace in the background luke we are all right you did great luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch looking for a number luke hey hey open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number where are we interior death star main forward bay service panel han over comlink three two six eight two seven interior death star tractor beam power generator trench ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam the trench seems to be a hundred miles deep the clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard the old jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables he carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal and several lights on the board go from red to blue interior death star unused hallway the group exits the garbage room into a dusty unused hallway han and luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts han if we can just avoid any more female advice we ought to be able to get out of here luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from solo luke well let us get moving chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room as he runs away and then stops howling han to chewie where are you going the dia nogu bangs against the hatch and a long slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim han aims his pistol leia no wait they will hear han fires at the doorway the noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway luke simply shakes his head in disgust han to chewie come here you big coward chewie shakes his head no han chewie come here leia listen i don't know who you are or where you came from but from now on you do as i tell you okay han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl han look your worshipfulness let us get one thing straight i take orders from one person me leia it is a wonder you are still alive looking at chewie will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way han watches her start away he looks at luke han no reward is worth this they follow her moving swiftly down the deserted corridor interior death star power trench suddenly a door behind ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench ben instantly slips into the shadows as an officer moves to within a few feet of him officer secure this area until the alert is canceled first trooper give me regular reports all but two of the stormtroopers leave first trooper do you know what is going on second trooper maybe it is another drill ben moves around the tractor beam

stormtroopers they quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway interior death star central core shaft luke and leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge deep shaft that seems to go into infinity the bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft and luke almost rushes into the abyss he loses his balance off the end of the bridge as leia behind him takes hold of his arm and pulls him back luke gasping i think we took a wrong turn blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger luke fires back at the advancing troops leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door leia there is no lock luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol luke that oughta hold it for a while leia quick we have got to get across find the control that extends the bridge luke oh i think i just blasted it luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds leia they are coming through luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt when laserfire hits the wall behind him luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them they exchange fire two more troops appear on another overhang also firing a trooper is hit and grabs at his chest another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by luke's laserfire and plummets down the shaft troopers move back off the bridge; luke hands the gun to leia luke here hold this luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt it has a grappler hook on it a trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at luke and leia as luke works with the rope leia returns the laser volley another trooper appears and fires at them as leia returns his fire as well suddenly the hatch door begins to open revealing the feet of more troops leia here they come leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above and he falls into the abyss luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes he tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure then grabs the princess in his arms leia looks at luke then kisses him quickly on the lips luke is very surprised leia for luck luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side just as luke and leia reach the far side of the canyon the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway interior death star narrow passageway ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway he checks to make sure they are gone then runs down

by a lightning movement of the sith a masterful slash stroke by vader is blocked by the old jedi another of the jedi's blows is blocked then countered ben moves around the dark lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar the two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid air creating a low buzzing sound vader your powers are weak old man ben

to penetrate the outer defense gold leader a rough looking man in his early thirties stands and addresses dodonna gold leader pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that dodonna well the empire doesn't consider a small one man fighter to be any threat or they'd have a tighter defense an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station artoo detoo stands next to a similar robot makes beeping sounds and turns his head from right to left dodonna the approach will not be easy you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point the target area is only two meters wide it is a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port the shaft leads directly to the reactor system a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station a murmer of disbelief runs through the room dodonna only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction the shaft
